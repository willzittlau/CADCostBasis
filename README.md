# CAD Cost Basis for YF

***This app is meant for personal/project use only.***

This script takes a YF Portfolio .csv and returns it in a $CAD cost basis, as YF currently doesn't have this option. This will also update your gain/loss info correctly to match changes from currency exchange.

*Feel free to use the included quotes.csv as a demo, just replace this file with your portfolio's quotes.csv for personal usage.*
